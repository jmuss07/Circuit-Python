## Hello_CircuitPython

### Description & Code
The code makes the Neopixel on the Metro Express flash a random color from a list of rainbow colors. It's looped so that every 0.1 seconds it chooses a different color from the same list.

```python
# Write your code here :-)
#This is Josie's pride and joy
import board
import neopixel
import time
import random

dot = neopixel.NeoPixel(board.NEOPIXEL, 1)

red = [204, 0, 0]
orange = [255, 50, 0]
yellow = [200, 100, 0]
green = [0, 230, 0]
blue = [0, 0, 255]
purple = [146, 0, 199]
color_list = [red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple]
print("Make it disco!!!")
dot.brightness = 0.1
while True:
    random_color = random.choice(color_list)
    dot.fill((random_color))
    time.sleep(0.1)


```


### Evidence
Look at it go!! So many random colors...

### Wiring
No wiring, all you need is and Adafruit Metro Express

### Reflection
This one worked well, and was pretty easy once I figured out the basic Cicuit Python commands. I then went through and decided to switch from just the required LED color change to experimenting with lists in order to achieve the final product.
